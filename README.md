üöÄ Project Functionalities
The Online Quiz Platform provides an intuitive way to create, take, and evaluate quizzes. The platform offers the following functionalities:

Overview:
Quiz Creation: Create quizzes with multiple-choice questions, specifying the correct answers.
Quiz Taking: Users can take quizzes, select answers, and receive instant feedback on their performance.
Real-time Results: The app calculates the score and provides detailed results once the quiz is completed.
Code Structure
The codebase is structured into various components, each handling specific functionalities within the quiz platform:

Components: All components of the project (like quiz creation, timer, and quiz taking) are structured within the src/components/ directory.
QuizCreation.jsx: Manages the creation of quizzes by adding questions, options, and correct answers.
Quiz.jsx: Handles the quiz-taking process, presenting questions and recording user answers.
AnswerTimer.jsx: Implements a countdown timer for each quiz question.
üíª Key Components
Quiz Creation (QuizCreation.jsx)
This component allows users to create quizzes by:

Adding questions and multiple-choice answers.
Specifying the correct answer for each question.
Quiz Taking (Quiz.jsx)
Users can take a quiz where:

They answer each question within a set time (managed by the AnswerTimer component).
Upon completing the quiz, their score is calculated in real-time and displayed.
Timer (AnswerTimer.jsx)
This component handles the countdown timer for each quiz question. When the timer runs out, the next question is automatically loaded, ensuring a time-bound quiz-taking experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Postman Collection (Optional)
If your project includes any API calls for handling data, mention that the Postman collection is available for testing endpoints. For this project, the backend could be assumed as external APIs (though not covered here).

üìä Sequence Diagram
The following sequence describes the basic flow of the quiz platform:

Client sends a request: The user creates or takes a quiz.
Server processes request: The application processes the quiz creation or the quiz-taking event (client-side logic for this demo project).
Server sends a response: The results or confirmation are presented to the user.
üö¶ Unit Testing
To ensure the application is working correctly, unit tests have been implemented. Run the following command to execute the tests:

bash
Copy code
npm test
This will run all the test cases for the various components in the project.

Future Enhancements
In the future, the platform could be expanded with the following features:

User Authentication: Allow users to create accounts, save their quiz progress, and track their quiz history.
Analytics: Provide detailed analytics for quiz creators, including how users performed on their quizzes.
Question Types: Add more question types like true/false, short answers, and fill-in-the-blanks.

Technologies Used
React.js: For building the frontend user interface.
CSS: For styling the components and making the design responsive.
Node.js & npm: For managing the project dependencies and running the development server.
Jest (optional): For testing components.
